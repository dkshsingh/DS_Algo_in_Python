## Data Structure and Alogrithm: 
#### A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.
## Types of data structure
### 1. System-defined data types (Primitive data types)
       The primitive data types provided by many programming languages are: int, noat, char, double, boo!, etc. 
### 2.User defined data types 
      struct new1'ypc { 
            int data 1; 
            float duta 2; 
            char data; 
      };
      
### Depending on the o rgan ization of the clements, data structures a rc c lassified into two types: 
#### l) Unear data structures: Elements are accessed in a sequentiaJ order but it is not compubory to store all 
####    elements sequentially. Examples: Linked Lists, Stacks alld Queues. 
#### 2) Non - linear data structures: Elements of this data structure arc stored /accessed in a non-linear order. 
####    Examples: Trees and graphs.
