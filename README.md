## Data Structure and Alogrithm: 
#### A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.
## Types of data structure
### 1. System-defined data types (Primitive data types)
       The primitive data types provided by many programming languages are: int, noat, char, double, boo!, etc. 
### 2.User defined data types 
      struct new1'ypc { 
            int data 1; 
            float duta 2; 
            char data; 
      };
      
### Depending on the organization of the clements, data structures are classified into two types: 
#### l) Unear data structures: Elements are accessed in a sequentiaJ order but it is not compubory to store all 
####    elements sequentially. Examples: Linked Lists, Stacks alld Queues. 
#### 2) Non - linear data structures: Elements of this data structure arc stored /accessed in a non-linear order. 
####    Examples: Trees and graphs.

## Rate Of Growth
     The rate at which the running time increases as a function of input is called rate of growth.

## Types of analysis
#### Worst Case 
      -->Defines the input for which the algorithm takes a long time. 
      -->Input is the one for which the algorithm runs the slowest. 

#### Best case
       -->Defines the input for which the algorithm takes the least time. 
       -->Input is the one for which the a lgorithm runs the fastest
#### Average case
       -->Provides a predict ion about the ru nning time or the a lgorithm. 
        -->Assumes that the input is random. 
        
   Lower Bound <= Average Time <= Upper Bound
